The enterprise challenge
========================

Building secure and globally compliant infrastructure means that Enterprise
environments are always amongst the most challenging hybrid environments in the
world. In the case of employment the Enterprise hybrid environment includes a
constantly changing mix of full-time employees, traditional vendors and
contingent staff and now it also includes Freelancers.

Like many of our industry peers we started our journey through assembling a
multi-disciplinary v-team including members of procurement, HR, legal and us
(the product team). While aligning across these groups and defining a program
(and Upwork agreement) that met all of our requirements was a significant amount
of work (amazingly everyone still talks to each other) – we quickly realized
that this was only the first step of our journey.

Actually using freelancers, and realizing the promise of the gig economy
empowers employees in a way that few innovations can (just like we experienced
with our first PC or smartphone, or previous generations with the steam engine).
Just as with these previous revolutions many employees start with a place of
fear and skepticism vs embracing the opportunity of this change.

In the case of working with freelancers it can be easy for employees to
struggle, as this change is tied to the digital transformation of the workplace
which is itself an emerging trend. If you don’t have the tools, processes and
practices to work effectively with geo-distributed remote teams then you won’t
be able to successfully leverage the gig economy.

The next step was getting everyone onto the right digital tools that would
enable them to work effectively with freelancers. The de-facto freelancing tools
that required employees to log into separate systems, supported 1:1
communication and used non-IT supported file-share were just to fragile and
inefficient for our teams to work effectively. Key examples include:

-   Separate systems: employees live in their day-to-day worktools (in our case
    this is Outlook and Microsoft Teams), when they are asked to use a separate
    tool for communication they end up checking it infrequently resulting in
    long-delays to their work projects.

-   File sharing: in many cases employees are working off large file
    repositories, and often they are collaborating on files with many people
    across many teams. Having to manually copy and paste these files into
    separate systems (e.g. a personal dropbox) to share with a freelancer leads
    to a ton of problems including lack of IT support, limited file size
    support, no automated virus scanning and version mismatch.

-   1:1 communication: efficient agile projects require transparent access to
    project information across the entire working team (scrum team). Silo’d
    communication – as is supported on the most popular freelance platforms –
    doesn’t work effectively in these scenarios.

Moving our freelancer pilot to the right tools was a major unlock, and enabled
us to start getting “real” work through the system vs 1-off projects. A large
portion of the M365 Freelance Connector is dedicated to helping you navigate
this phase of your journey.

A related, but equally important unlock was having teams change their processes,
from highly-centralized, email/skype centric models to processes that worked
more efficiently for decentralized teams (in our case we found Teams + Planner
to be a huge unlock). This change actually made our teams more productive and
efficient even without using freelancers (digital transformation of the
workplace), the addition of freelancers significantly magnified these
efficiencies – multiplying our productivity in a way that was truly
transformative.

We hope that this guide enables you to create your own successful gig economy
pilot in your enterprise as you take into account the specific requirements and
needs of your organization.
