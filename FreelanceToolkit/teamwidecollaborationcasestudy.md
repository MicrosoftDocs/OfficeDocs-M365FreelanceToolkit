Team-wide communications case study 
===================

Beth, a training manager at Microsoft, leads a team of four full time employees and a continuous flow freelancers in production of Microsoft Office training videos. She just found out that she has six months to create 150 training videos. At her current capacity, this feat is unattainable. A month ago they introduced Upwork. Upwork significantly increased their cost and time to production, but 150 still eclipses their capacity. They currently make 20 videos per month. Getting to 150 videos would require making 125 a month. 

Beth first talks about it with her daughter Jessica, a PM at a Silicon Valley real estate startup. Jessica shows her mom the tools they use – Slack, Trello, and G-Suite. It makes intuitive sense, but could it work in the enterprise?  

The next day, she ran across Derek, a PM who manages a team creating article content. Derek empathized with Beth’s dilemma. A month ago his boss gave him the same unrealistic target. Derek knew about the typical cloud-based solutions of Slack, Trello, and G-Suite. Derek’s son Tommy is a full time freelancer, and showed Derek how he managed a freelance workflow with these tools. For the next two weeks Derek tried these tools, but realized quickly they broke in his companies ecosystem and provided inadequate security. 

Luckily, at the tail end of this he saw Satya Nadella’s announcement of free Teams, a platform for communication & collaboration, and the teams productivity increased dramatically. He gave Beth a demo, and out of desperation Beth decided to give it a try. 

For just the full time employees, Beth and her team used chat channels within teams instead of emails. These channels housed all files. 
They housed all notes through OneNote. And they were the hub for all meetings that mixed both virtual and in person attendants.
