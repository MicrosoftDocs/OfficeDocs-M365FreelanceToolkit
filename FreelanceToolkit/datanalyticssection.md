Data analytics 
===================

Data analytics with PowerBI 
----------------------------

What if you could collect and customize real time data to make data-driven
business decisions about your freelance program?

For Chad, a director of strategic sourcing, and a procurement leader on the Gig
Economy v-team, he leverages real time data to show upper management that
freelance isn’t just a flash in the pan. That instead, by comparing it side by
side with existing external staffing options, it is consistently better, faster,
and cheaper by leaps and bounds.

Challenge in the enterprise
---------------------------

A major challenge in scaling an enterprise program is tracking and communicating
business performance via enterprise specific KPI’s. Due to the volume and
complexity within your enterprise, data is not only hard to capture, but hard to
communicate effectively.

This effects:

-   Your ability to make data-driven decisions

-   Your ability to compare freelance spend with existing external staffing
    options

-   Your ability to identify which groups within your organization and which
    freelance talent categories work best within your organization

With [Microsoft PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/), a suite of
business analytics tools, you can collect end-to-end, real time data from every
source, and customize data visualization dashboards.
