Workflow automation
===================

As a program administrator, what if you could focus on value driving activities
like engagement and retention instead of repetitive manual tasks like data
input?

For Liane, a freelance program manager, she was able to automate workflows using
if this, then that, logic between the various applications she was manually
processing, including but not limited to:

-   From compliance training videos to email follow ups and creation of a user’s
    profile on the talent management platform

-   From a user’s first project application to email follow ups on whether the
    project was accepted or denied

-   From newsletter signups, to databases and groups

By automating these administrative, operational, and manual tasks, Liane was
able to focus on growing demand and retention within the program by providing a
frictionless experience for the end user.

Challenge in the enterprise
---------------------------

While unchecked workflows can fit in an infographic, the real end-to-end process
required to operationalize and govern a freelance program looks like below:

It is hard to streamline vs. create complexity. Especially, for an enterprise
not born in the cloud. A freelance program requires provisioning, compliance,
monitoring, all while increasing demand by providing a frictionless process for
the end user.

With [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/), you can create
automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to get
notifications, synchronize files, collect data, and more.
