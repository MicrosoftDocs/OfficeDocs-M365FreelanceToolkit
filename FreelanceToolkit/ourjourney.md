Our journey 
======================================

Every week we talk to another full-time employee whose life has been positively
and fundamentally changed by their access to freelance resources through the gig
economy. Whether it’s helping them achieve work-life balance, re-skill
themselves, or achieve more we’ve seen them move from skeptics to promoters; the
Microsoft 365 Freelance Connector is designed to help you achieve the same results in
your company. 

As part of a content creation organization within Microsoft our team was one of
the first to be exposed to the idea of leveraging freelancers and the gig
economy. By early 2017 we realized that the implications of the gig economy were
much broader than we initially realized, and we made the decision to make a
targeted investment in creating and pursuing a gig economy strategy. In November 
2017, we partnered with Upwork to pursue a gig economy strategy. 

One of our earliest principles was to focus on a Customer Zero approach – where
we would be our own “Customer Zero”. This means that all of the samples,
templates, best practices and case studies are informed by our own experiences
of deploying a freelance program within the Enterprise. While these practices
are applicable to companies of any size, the challenges and processes inherent
to a large multi-national enterprise make it a uniquely challenging
environment.  

Taking a Customer Zero approach required us to drive significant internal
adoption (to enable us to get the data required to learn). Once we launched our
internal program (in partnership with Upwork in November 2017) we worked to
quickly get as many projects completed across as many different organizations
and domains as possible.  

As individuals and teams posted more projects they learnt, and while some of
these learnings were unique to the individual and team – there were many that
were broadly applicable that we captured in case studies and best practices. 

When talking to our customers (many of whom were trying to run similar pilots)
we quickly recognized that there was an opportunity to publish our experiences
to provide real benefit to our customers. This site represents the first
manifestation of this realization. Each enterprise will need to evaluate how 
the use of the gig economy meets its own requirements and needs, including such 
things as intellectual property protections, data handling, and compliance requirements.
